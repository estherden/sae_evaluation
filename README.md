### Instructions:
Code should be run in order (as numbered). Scripts preceded by 00- contain functions that will be sourced by the scripts as necessary. Scripts with xx-a contain code for the simulation study with TOPALS and D-splines. Scripts with xx-b contain code for the simulation study with the SVD-model.

### Sources
References are given as inline comments in the corresponding scripts. Main references are:
* https://github.com/schmert/TOPALS which contains the original code used in 00-topals.R
* https://github.com/schmert/D-spline-replication which contains the original code used in 00-dsplines.R
* The stan code (base_model_1mean.stan) was provided by Ameer Dharamshi (personal communication, 2022) who granted permission to upload the code.
